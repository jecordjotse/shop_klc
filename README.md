# KLC SHOP


This is my first php project. Decided to upload to github as it's being on my local machine for years now.
The idea was to build an ecommence site for shoes.
I was interested in only php so pardon my lack of an UI

After the first commit what I want to do is improve this over the years
I will have commits with major activity listed below so we follow through.
